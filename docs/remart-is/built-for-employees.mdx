# re:mart is built for employees

re:mart is a for-profit company, and while it has a typical balance sheet, success is measured to optimize for employee income, not net profit.

Shareholder models work, but they depend on trust, as shareholders can sabotage a company for a payout. I trust you, but better than "trust but verify" is "build a relationship that verifies themselves".

Don't go long on my value, go long on my people.

Not to associate this with Cryptocurrency, but the idea of a "trustless" system is a good one, but when incentives remain perverse and contested, "where there's a will there's a way". This is an attempt to align incentives, as to eclipse each other entirely, and remove the need for trust.

## how does that work?

re:mart operates on a concept called "interest-holders", which is a unique form of investment where returns are a function of employee incomes, not net profit. Or, in other words, the more money employees make, the more money interest-holders make. 

If we don't beat inflation, you don't beat inflation. 

If we get a Christmas Bonus, you get a Christmas Bonus.

Wait, you're saying you're Cisco and you want to deliver my milk direct, saving me 20%, and you want to be an interest holder, "buying in" just before we sign the contract? Cool, and totally legal. No joke.

## that's legal?

Yeah, it's a loan, where the interest is a function of time and an interest rate. Which is a pretty common thing, but instead of the interest being fixed, it's variable and based on a measurable business metric.

Say this sentence out loud "I wanted to sell directly to a customer, and to help them increase their capacity, I loaned them money on a fixed interest rate, where the interest was a function of their employee income, and I was paid back in full, with interest, in 5 years."

That's a loan. That's legal. That's what this is.

## show me.

Ok, this is a simple, unpolished algorithm, but you can calculate returns on a napkin, seeing returns every two weeks.

<InterestHolders />

## show me the math.

$$
i={\frac{(\Delta income \cdot \Delta income^a)}{\Delta headcount^b}}
$$

and then returns are a simple interest at that rate, where

$$
Accrued = Principal(1+rate \cdot time)
$$

and then returns are a function of time, and are paid out every two weeks, *adjusted for income and headcount during that period*.

So, any change in income or headcount, up or down, will affect the interest rate, and therefore the returns.

The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are the $collective\ income$ and $headcount$ coefficients, respectively, and are unique to each contract, as goals and expectations change over time. Both can be adjusted to reward the increase, decrease, or maintenance of headcount or income, or both.

This function can be adopted and tuned to use distributions and skews, but I chose an exponential function because it's simple, and leans heavy into long term growth, or just maintaining course.

I could say "Interest is a function of keeping everything exactly the same. No headcount change, no need for explosive, year over year growth" and find metrics and distributions to incorporate.

I could also say "we need to reduce headcount, and increase income" and find metrics and distributions to incorporate. 

## but conflict of interest?

Since our prices are "at-cost", and we don't sell your data, the money we are leant can never come charged with obligations or expectations, other than to force wages up, as thats the only metric of their return. We can get money from Coca-Cola, because carbonated beverages are actually pretty heavy, physically, and costs me money to deliver, and so I guess I actually preferred you buy cotton balls, but carbonated beverages are what I hope to sell more of haha.

In fact, I invite Coca-Cola to join us, and help us deliver their products to our customers, and we'll split the cost of delivery with the customer, making it far cheaper, and we'll all make more money together. But the only customer experience difference is we cut out every middleman cost, saving customers money. I don't make any more or less money selling Coke over Pepsi, and so I don't care what you buy, and Coke will only see returns if employees make more money, and so they don't care what you buy, either, as long as you buy it from us.

So, Coca-Cola, if you're reading this, give us a chunk of change, and then contract with us to deliver Coca-Cola products to our customers, and when all of our wages rise, the return on your investment goes up immediately. Advertise on our behalf, using your budget, and then see a spike in sales, which leads to a spike in wages, which leads to a spike in your returns.

The sky is the limit.

## tell me your ideas

What if we made Interest Holders a function of insurance coverage of headcount? Or a function of employee turnover, negatively correlated as to incentivize interest holders to reduce it? You can mix and match metrics to create a unique contract that counters bad actors with mathematics, not trust, or legal observance, or how something or someone looks on paper.

## what if I want to sell?

Sell it like any other loan, because its a loan. There are laws that regulate that as it's nothing new. No need for NASDAQ though.

<!-- Ok. But know I only ever got to Statistics, and just barely. So, I'm going to do my best, but I'm sure I'm going to get something wrong. If you see something, say something lmao.

$$
i = {\frac {n \cdot (\Delta w + \Delta w^2)}{\Delta e^h}}
$$

Where:

$w$ is the collective employee $wealth$, wealth being income, including bonuses, benefits, and other compensation

$e$ is the number of $employees$

$h$ is employee $headcount$ coefficient and 

$n$ is the collective wealth coefficient

$i$ is the interest rate, which is a simple interest rate for the loan, and is a function of time, and is paid out every two weeks, *adjusted for income and headcount during that period*. -->
