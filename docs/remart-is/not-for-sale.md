# re:mart is not for sale

We don't have partnerships with brands, we don't have any in-app ads, we don't adjust the search results for anyone in any way, and we do nothing to tell anyone apart until its time to purchase.

Seriously, just tell us what you want, not what other people think you want, and we'll get it for you.

## but sometimes being sold to is fun

I am that dude who tries every novelty Pepsi product with decreasing levels of enthusiasm. I love trying new things, and I love being sold to. I studied marketing in college, and so I really like marketing. But not when I'm trying to buy milk, eggs, cheese, and other neccesary, unnegotiable items.

## enter "re:market"

So, opt-in. I'm separately starting the first Indie Ad company that makes no comissions, provides no feedback to brands, manufacturers, or advertisers, and is completely transparent. With your permission, we can plug re:market into your re:mart account, and be shown a perfectly honest curation of products that you might like, based on your purchase history, some wildcards, and surprises, but none of the pressure, deception, or manipulation that comes with traditional advertising.

Turn it off whenever you want, and we'll never show you another advertisement again.

## what about investors?

We don't sell shares of stock, but we do need funding, so we do that in the form of ["Interest Holding"](/docs/remart-is/built-for-employees), where companies or individuals can lend us money to support and expand operations, but interest is a function of employee income, not net profit, nor any specific type of item being sold, so there is no incentive to sell more of one thing over another.
