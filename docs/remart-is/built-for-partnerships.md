# re:mart is built for partnerships

## lattice "lore"

Just how you don't need to know the specifics of how a car works to drive one, you don't need to know the specifics of how re:mart works to use it. But, just like how knowing how a car works can help you drive it better, knowing how re:mart works can help you use it better, and even extend and contribute to it, yourself!

I spent a lot of time thinking about how to structure re:mart, and I think I've come up with a pretty good solution. I call it a "lattice", which is a type of company that is built of a lot of smaller, independent, but interdependent companies in a way that deduplicates work, and allows for narrower specialization. [There is more on that here](/docs/lattice-is/a-type-of-business), but for now, let me talk about how that applies to re:mart, without you needing to know the specifics of how a lattice works.

But in nature, specifically Chemistry, a lattice is a structure of atoms that are arranged and interconnected in a repeating pattern, and the way the atoms connect determines the properties of the material. For example, a diamond is a lattice of carbon atoms, and graphite is a lattice of carbon atoms, but the way the atoms are connected is different, and so they have different properties. 

re:mart is just one atom, looking to partner and share resources with other atoms, to form a lattice, with each layer providing a new specialization, and strengthening the structure as a whole.

## in short, join my company

* Are you a Dietician? Cool, because I'm accumulating price, nutrition, ingredient, and customer review database for every large retailer across America, and it's yours to use if you split the bill with me, which is about $50 a month. Join my company, or "lattice". You don't get access to my client data, that's private, but you can use my product data to help your clients shop for the best deals on the healthiest foods. And if our individual customers are interested, they can use our products together to help them shop for the best deals on the healthiest foods.

* Are you wanting to start a Meal Prep Box Subscription Service? Cool, because I have all the logistics figured out, and you can white-label my service, and I'll take care of all the sourcing, delivery, and customer service, and you can focus on the marketing and branding. You can even use my database of prices to help you figure out how much to charge, and more.

* Are you a Delivery Service? Cool, because I know a Dietician, a Meal Prep Box Subscription Service, and a Supply Chain Company that you can partner with, with no setup. And all three of us have put together some money to help you finance scaling up. 

* Are you an Accountant? Cool, because we all separately need Accounting work, and so join us, and we'll split the cost between us.

Now, repeat that for everything you can think of, and we can do everything and anything, one thing at a time, together.

And now, you have a lattice. It's like a small village of vendors and customers, all working together to help each other out, and all making money together. 

## let's negotiate as a team

Do we want and Adobe License? Cool, since we all belong to the same company, those of us who want it can join together to get a higher tiered license for less money.

Let's all negotiate for insurance together. Or, let's parter with a few insurance companies, and set up our own little mini marketplace. Or better yet, let's partner with a healthcare company directly, sidestepping insurance as much as possible. They get access to our network of atomic companies, we get access to their services.

Want to get a company cell phone plan? Or three? How about a beach house?

Hey, since Top Golf is one of Tom's Customers, we get a deal on a corporate box. Who wants to go in on it?

And let's have a ton of credit cards with rewards points and just share them amongst ourselves. No need for fun budget, we're going to Fiji with the SkyMiles and Hilton Rewards we got from buying groceries.

## let's sell to each other

Since we all need a Database, let's just get one of us to start a Database Company, that is a thin layer on top of an existing Database-as-a-Service, and we'll all use that, and split the cost, and get us all to the highest tier, and we'll all get a discount.

Do we want to rent a shared office space? Cool, let's get one and split the cost, and anyone can move in or out as they please.

## what else can you think of?

The problem ceases to become "what can we attempt to try next", and becomes "what are we one step away from already doing?"
