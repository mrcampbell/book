# re:mart is a supply-chain company

The CEO of Toyota isn't shopping at [local big box store] for tires for the next shipment of cars. They have a team of people dedicated solely to the purpose of procuring tires. 

But you? You're wandering warehouses of impulse traps to get to the milk that is shelved at the back of the store because you spend more money that way.

If you're shopping online, you're shown 40 things, as well as "things other people bought", "did you actually mean this?" and other "things related to your search" to get you to buy more, when again, you just want milk.

## how do we fix it?

We don't. Just don't particpate in it. The obstruction and friction of shopping is a feature, not a bug. It's designed to get you to spend more money, and it works.

So, we'll be your "supply chain team". We'll get you the things you want, when you want them, for as cheap as possible, and get them to you as cheaply as possible. No games, coupons, rewards points, free shipping, just delivering you your stuff, at cost.

## what does that look like?

Tell us what you need, and we'll get it for you once, twice, weekly, monthly, whenever you say, for as long as you want, for $15 per cart. That's it. No markups, no margins, no bullshit. We'll even tell you how much we paid for it, and how much we saved you. You get all the dopamine of getting a great deal, without the hassle of having to find it yourself.

Have roommates? Combine all your purchases so you all only pay once.

Have a growing family? Save by buying in bulk, and never worry about running out of diapers again.

Going out of town? Save by having a fully stocked cabinet waiting for you when you arrive, and a fully stocked kitchen when you get back. 

## search for your favorites

Filter by brand, sort by price, search by keyword and tell us the exact item you want. Designs are still coming, but just how you shop for clothes by item, and then color and size, shopping for groceries should be the same.

Pick what you want, then the size, flavor, color - never needing to worry about it being sold out or not available, because you're shopping everywhere at once.

## or let us choose for you

Every week, I buy one pound of Tillamook Cheddar Cheese, without compromise. I don't care if it's on sale, or if there's a better deal, my kids eat that cheese, and that's that. But 1% Milk is 1% Milk, and I don't care what brand it is, what farm it came from, as long as it's cheap. So I'll let re:mart choose what milk and from where, and I'll save money on that, and spend it on cheese.

Same with cage-free eggs, bulk flour, banana-flavored granola -- be as specific or as vague as you want, and we'll get you the best deal that satisfies it.

## we'll get it for you

I have a massive database of retail prices and a propriatary search algorithm that takes in your shopping list of varying specificity and match it to items at specific retailers in your area. I combine your purchases with others, move them around town, and get them to your home, and pay everyone involved well, all for $15.

## no bullshit

We are just a supply-chain company. We aren't procurement, so we're not haggling or managing shipments - we are the last 5-miles of the supply chain, and we're just trying to get you the best deal on the things you want, and get them to you as cheaply as possible. We don't care what you buy, how much you spend, nor do we have any incentive to track your data, because we can't do anything with it other than use it to improve our service.

You should be able to buy a pregnancy test without being bombarded with ads for diapers. That's invasive and creepy. We can anonymize your purchase so the retailer doesn't know who you are. Except for cold medicine, because that's a legal thing, but no one needs to know if you're a Pepsi or Coke person, just that you get what you like.
