title: a lattice is a type of business
---

In nature, a lattice is a structure of atoms that are arranged and interconnected in a repeating pattern, and the way the atoms connect determines the properties of the material. For example, a diamond is a lattice of carbon atoms, and graphite is a lattice of carbon atoms, but the way the atoms are connected is different, and so they have different properties.

Businesses operate the way they do because the people who stand to profit the most have the most influence, and so naturally they create systems that provide them with the most profit. This is why we have things like "planned obsolescence", "dark patterns", and "surveillance capitalism".

Rather than regulation, which is a game of whack-a-mole, we need to change the fundamental structure of how businesses operate. We need to change the way atoms are connected.

## same stuff, just organized differently

lattice, in the context of business (which is the only one we'll use it in from here on out), is a type of company that is built of a lot of smaller, independent, but interdependent companies in a way that deduplicates work, and allows for narrower specialization.

lattice doesn't introduce any new concepts, but rather forms meaningful and guided abstractions of existing concepts. It has a balance sheet, but that balance sheet acts as a micro-economy for its resident villagers, each providing a specific purpose, and either selling it to each other, or direct to customer.

Instead of an HR department, you have an HR company that sells services to the other companies in the lattice. If that HR department sucks, you start a competing one. If your justifications were correct, you'll get more business, and if not, you'll go out of business. But the cool thing is you didn't actually go out of business because you're an employee of lattice, so get to work on something else.

A system of capitalism that seeks growth at the cost of all else will consume all else. lattice is a system of capitalism that measures against and strives for homeostasis. Things in nature only get as big as they should, and when they exceed those limits, they either invest heavily in maintaining homeostasis or collapse.


It does this by drawing upon ideas from nature operates as a single organism, where each company is a cell, and each cell is dedicated to a specific function, and all cells work together to _maintain homeostasis_, not grow infinitely.
