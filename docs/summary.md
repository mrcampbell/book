# the summary

re:mart is a company that will deliver groceries to your home, often for less than it takes to shop. You search our database of local items that you want, and we source them from retailers in your area, using the data we've harvested from online advertisements to get you the best price every time. It's like shopping at all of your local stores at once, but better in that we're committed to being unbiased, and private. We do that in two ways:

1. We sell everything at-cost, without markups or margins, and instead charge a flat fee for delivery, which should be about $15. 
1. That fee is our only source of income. That means we have no side-hustles, ulterior motives, or other conflicts of interest. 

These two things make it so that we don't care what you buy, how much you spend, nor do we have any incentive to track your data, because we can't do anything with it other than use it to improve our service.

Every word, image, and line of code is dedicated to making it worth it to you as possible so you come back, and that's it.

Not only that, but we have the potential to save customers more than we charge them, essentially making our services not only free, but mildy profitable. If you spend $200 on groceries, and we save you more than 8%, you're now "making money" by using our service.

## but how?

As to how this is all possible is simple, but contextual, and is explained here in "the book". re:mart is actually structured as a specific type of company, the first of its kind, called a "lattice". While not essential to understanding how to use the service, it is essential to understanding why it exists, and how it works, and most importantly, how to join and contribute.

Tell me more about: [what re:mart is](/docs/remart-is/a-supply-chain-company)
